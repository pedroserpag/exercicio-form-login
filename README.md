# Exercise form login

This is an improvement training, where I'm putting my learning into practice, because I'm starting in the field of web development.
The project is an access login area that was made with HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT.

- Layout of the page, where the user must enter his registration (Username and Password),only HMTL and CSS were applied:

- In this other image, Javascript was used to confirm and validate it if the user tries to log in without entering data:
